        <h3><em>HER</em></h3>
        <p>She's the girl who can't fully communicate her feelings<br>even with the people she loves the most<br>Every time she starts to talk it feels like a word clot forms in her head<br>then she's suddenly confused on what to say</p>
        <p>She's the girl who loves staying true to her inner child<br>She takes time to color in coloring books or painting a painting<br>or just finding joy swinging on swings<br>or just playing video games</p>
        <p>She's the girl who has had a few heart breaks<br>Mostly due to the fact that when she loves, she loves hard<br>Giving her precious heart to the wrong people<br>and commiting to people who never committed to her<br>never seeing the red flags until its too late</p>
        <p>She's the girl learning from her mistakes<br>Using her past traumas as a way to grow<br>Strengthening her mind, body, and soul<br>so that when she looks in the mirror she'll sile<br>not just because of her beauty but also because of her glow</p>
        <p>She's the girl writing this so that she can always go back and read it over and over again to remind herselfof the beautiful queen she has become<br>Despite the communication issues, the "immaturity", and the heart breaks<br>the girl that chooses to focus on the growth<br><strong>The girl that's me</strong></p>
